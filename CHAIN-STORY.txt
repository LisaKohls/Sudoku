One day, one of the Lisas was walking down the street.
She was happy because the sun was shining.
But suddenly a cloud appeared at the sky and blocked the sunlight.
Lisa looked at the sky sadly and started crying.
Interesting how emotions can be changed by weather.
But they can also be changed by eating good food!
People in southern countries tend to be happier.
Maybe that is the case because they have better food over there, or because there is more sunlight.
We will never know...
